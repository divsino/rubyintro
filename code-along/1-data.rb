# To run this code, be sure your current working directory

# Put my favorite thing on screen 
# puts "tacos"

# True, False

# puts true 
# puts false

# # Nothing
# # puts nil

# # Variables
# # store the number 5 in the computers memory
# zebra = 5
# # show the value contained at x on screen
# puts zebra

# #replace the value of zebra with 6
# zebra = 6
# puts zebra

# zebra = zebra + 1
# puts zebra

# Combine strings and variables
#store my favorite things in memory
my_favorite_thing = "tacos"
# store a quantity in memory
number_of_things = 3
# store the two together
puts "my order is.. #{number_of_things} #{my_favorite_thing}"
